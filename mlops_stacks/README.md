# mlops_stacks
This project comes with example ML code to train, validate and deploy a regression model to predict NYC taxi fares.
If you're a data scientist just getting started with this repo for a brand new ML project, we recommend 
adapting the provided example code to your ML problem. Then making and 
testing ML code changes on Databricks or your local machine.

The "Getting Started" docs can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/dev-tools/bundles/mlops-stacks.

This directory contains an ML project based on the default
[Databricks MLOps Stacks](https://github.com/databricks/mlops-stacks),
defining a production-grade ML pipeline for automated retraining and batch inference of an ML model on tabular data.

## Iterating on ML code

### Deploy ML code and resources to dev workspace using Bundles

Refer to [Local development and dev workspace](./resources/README.md#local-development-and-dev-workspace)
to use databricks CLI bundles to deploy ML code together with ML resource configs to dev workspace.

This will allow you to develop locally and use databricks CLI bundles to deploy to your dev workspace to test out code and config changes.

### Develop on Databricks using Databricks Repos

#### Prerequisites
You'll need:
* Access to run commands on a cluster running Databricks Runtime ML version 11.0 or above in your dev Databricks workspace
* To set up [Databricks Repos](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/repos/index): see instructions below

#### Configuring Databricks Repos
To use Repos, [set up git integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/repos/repos-setup) in your dev workspace.

If the current project has already been pushed to a hosted Git repo, follow the
[UI workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/repos/git-operations-with-repos#add-a-repo-and-connect-remotely-later)
to clone it into your dev workspace and iterate. 

Otherwise, e.g. if iterating on ML code for a new project, follow the steps below:
* Follow the [UI workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/repos/git-operations-with-repos#add-a-repo-and-connect-remotely-later)
  for creating a repo, but uncheck the "Create repo by cloning a Git repository" checkbox.
* Install the `dbx` CLI via `pip install --upgrade dbx`
* Run `databricks configure --profile mlops_stacks-dev --token --host <your-dev-workspace-url>`, passing the URL of your dev workspace.
  This should prompt you to enter an API token
* [Create a personal access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth/pat)
  in your dev workspace and paste it into the prompt from the previous step
* From within the root directory of the current project, use the [dbx sync](https://dbx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/python/devloop/mixed/#using-dbx-sync-repo-for-local-to-repo-synchronization) tool to copy code files from your local machine into the Repo by running
  `dbx sync repo --profile mlops_stacks-dev --source . --dest-repo your-repo-name`, where `your-repo-name` should be the last segment of the full repo name (`/Repos/username/your-repo-name`)



## Next Steps

When you're satisfied with initial ML experimentation (e.g. validated that a model with reasonable performance can be trained on your dataset) and ready to deploy production training/inference pipelines, ask your ops team to set up CI/CD for the current ML project if they haven't already. CI/CD can be set up as part of the

MLOps Stacks initialization even if it was skipped in this case, or this project can be added to a repo setup with CI/CD already, following the directions under "Setting up CI/CD" in the repo root directory README.

To add CI/CD to this repo:
 1. Run `databricks bundle init mlops-stacks` via the Databricks CLI
 2. Select the option to only initialize `CICD_Only`
 3. Provide the root directory of this project and answer the subsequent prompts

More details can be found on the homepage [MLOps Stacks README](https://github.com/databricks/mlops-stacks/blob/main/README.md).
